# The polkit agent isn't started by systemd, but is rather usually run as a
# non-root user by way of /etc/xdg/autostart. Running everything in
# /etc/xdg/autostart would be bad here because sysmaint's graphical session is
# intentionally running as few services as possible to keep attack surface
# low. At the same time there's no robust way to pick out just the polkit
# agent from /etc/xdg/autostart, so we have to hardcode them. One enhancement
# might be to hardcode a whole list of agents and then only start the one we
# find listed in /etc/xdg/autostart (assuming there's only one of them), but
# for now this works well. When this script gains support for window managers
# beyond xfwm4, expanding our polkit agent support may be a good idea.
#
# Turns out we also need msgcollector, which has to be started the same way.
